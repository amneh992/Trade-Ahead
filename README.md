#  Unsupervised Learning – Customer Segmentation

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to group customers based on behavioral and demographic attributes. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns in the data to support targeted marketing and personalized customer engagement strategies.

The analysis uses clustering algorithms such as **KMeans** and **DBSCAN** to segment customers, and evaluates the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** and silhouette scores.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Segment customers into meaningful groups based on behavioral features.
- **Dataset:** Includes attributes such as income, spending score, region, and age.
- **Approach:** Perform data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and apply multiple clustering methods.

## Techniques & Tools

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Clustering: KMeans, DBSCAN
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA (optional)
- Cluster Evaluation: Elbow Method, Silhouette Score
- Visualizations: Seaborn, Matplotlib

---

## Key Insights

- Identified distinct customer profiles such as high-income low-spenders and mid-income high-spenders.
- DBSCAN revealed outliers that KMeans couldn’t isolate.
- Recommended marketing strategies tailored to each cluster’s behavior and preferences.
